Great both the boys are here at the same time. Where do I put them?

* {left == "wrestler"} No. You need him elsewhere.
*right side
~right=wrestler
~right=doctor
-The choice depends on what you think will better suit you.
* {right == "wrestler"} Yes. That way the wrestler will be where the doctor is not.
* {right == "doctor"} No. You need him elsewhere.
I have brought both of you here to decide on my boyfriend.
*boyfriend choice
~boyfriend=doctor
~boyfriend=wrestler
-Better make the right one or you ight regret it.
* {boyfriend == "wrestler"} Yes. You will be on the road and see new sights.
* {boyfriend == "doctor"} No. You will be stuck in the same place forever.
* {boyfriend == "wrestler"} No. You will be stuck on the road with the same people.
* {boyfriend == "doctor"} Yes. You will be able to do what you want.
I am glad I chose what I did and I don't regret it.
